# Milestones and Ticket Plan

Milestone definitions (P0–P3) and acceptance criteria are in `GAME_VISION.md` §10–§11.

## Ticket 0 findings

- The repository was empty: no commits, branches, code, build or tests.
- Engine chosen: Godot 4 with a plain C# simulation core (see D-001).
- Cloud dev environment: .NET 8 SDK installs from the Ubuntu package feed, and NuGet is
  reachable, so simulation code can be built and tested here. Godot itself cannot be
  downloaded here because GitHub releases are blocked, so scene work must be run locally.
- Against the P0 and P1 plans, nothing is implemented yet.

## Ticket 1 — Solution scaffold, core data model and invariants

**Scope.** Create `Expedition.sln`, `src/Expedition.Simulation` (net8.0, nullable enabled,
warnings as errors) and `tests/Expedition.Simulation.Tests` (xUnit). Add minimal models:
- `CharacterId`, `ItemId` and similar strongly typed IDs, with a campaign-scoped ID allocator.
- `Character`: identity (name, age, origin), skills (`SkillId → 0..5`), needs (hunger, thirst,
  fatigue, stress as 0–100), health (0–100, plus a list of conditions), traits (IDs),
  survival state, and an inventory reference.
- `CampaignState`: phase, roster keyed by ID, chronicle.
- `CampaignPhase` enum and a transition table with `TryTransition(target, out reason)`.
- `Chronicle` with append-only entries.

**Out of scope:** tasks, time, items beyond IDs, save/load, Godot.

**Acceptance.**
- Models have no Godot dependency and carry XML doc comments on their public members.
- Validation rejects out-of-range skills and needs, duplicate IDs, and resurrection of the dead.
- Tests: ID uniqueness across many allocations; skill range validation; invalid phase
  transitions rejected and recorded; a dead character is reported ineligible to work.
- `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` pass.

**Risks.** Over-modelling fields that P1 does not need. Mitigation: only the fields listed above.

**Result.** Implemented as specified, except the character's inventory reference, which moves to
Ticket 3 together with inventories. Survival state changes go through
`CampaignState.ChangeSurvivalState`, so they are validated and recorded in the chronicle.
42 xUnit tests pass.

## Ticket 2 — Simulation clock and task execution

**Depends on:** Ticket 1.
**Scope.** Fixed-tick `SimulationClock` and the seeded serializable RNG (D-002).
`TaskDefinition` (requirements, duration, need effects, resource cost) loaded from `data/tasks`.
`TaskInstance` with progress, completion and interruption. Needs change according to the
current activity, so rest recovers fatigue and work adds it.
**Acceptance.** Headless tests cover: fatigue accumulating while working and recovering while
resting; a task interrupted when a character becomes incapacitated; a task that is ineligible
because a skill or tool is missing; identical results for an identical seed.
**Risks.** Tick granularity affects balance. Keep need rates in data so they can be tuned.

**Result.** Implemented: one-minute ticks (D-004), the PCG32 generator (D-002), and task
definitions, need rates and rules loaded from `data/`, where unknown or misspelled fields are
rejected. Tasks check skill, tools, materials and fatigue before they start; work speed scales
with skill and drops when tired. Exhaustion, incapacitation and injury interrupt work. Hazardous
tasks can injure, incapacitate or kill, and every such outcome is recorded in the chronicle.
82 xUnit tests pass.

Deliberately left for later:
- `CampaignState.Supplies` is a plain stockpile with no weight or volume yet (Ticket 3).
- Item IDs in task data are not validated until item definitions exist (Ticket 3).
- Hunger and thirst do not yet harm health at 100; that comes with eating and drinking (Ticket 3).
- Incapacitated characters do not recover yet; that needs treatment tasks (Ticket 6).
- Materials are used up when a task starts and are not refunded if it is interrupted.

## Ticket 3 — Inventory, supplies, and save/load

**Depends on:** Tickets 1–2.
**Scope.** `ItemDefinition` (weight, volume, consumable flag) and stacks. Inventories with
capacity limits, including ship cargo. Food and water consumption over time. Versioned JSON
save/load (D-003) covering the clock, RNG state, roster, tasks, inventories and chronicle.
Also: replace the Ticket 2 `Stockpile` with real inventories; validate item IDs in task data;
eating and drinking reduce hunger and thirst, and health suffers when either stays at 100.
A save made with task definitions that no longer exist must fail with a clear error.
**Acceptance.** A 30-day provisions test consumes the expected amounts. A save followed by a
load produces an equivalent state (structural comparison). A corrupt or newer-version save
fails with a clear error. A dead character stays dead after loading.
**Risks.** Save schema churn while models are young. Mitigation: a version field and a
migration hook from the first save.
